I have tried to made this page from scratch, i have been converted from figma source to code, the figma source will be linked below 

https://dribbble.com/shots/16643653-Radial-Scroll-Bar-Interaction

i used three js to made sphere mesh and locomotive scroll to made slider photos.

i also used vite to run the project.

you should use npm to install three js and locomotive scroll:

open your git or terminal and follow steps below:
 - npm create vite@latest
 - npm i three gsap
 - cd vite-project
 - npm run dev
 
 thats it, enjoy
